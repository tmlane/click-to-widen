Since this extension is still in development, it isn't available on the chrome webstore. You can still use it by doing the following:

###  Cloning the Project Locally

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Use git to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmlane/click-to-widen.git
```

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

- Open Google Chrome.
- Navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- At the top right, enable "Developer mode".
- Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the Click to Widen repository and select the folder. The extension should now be added to Chrome.

## Using the extension:
- Click the extension icon to activate.
- Hover over a page element to highlight it.
- Click the highlighted element to expand its width.
- Click the extension icon again to deactivate (Note: Expanded elements will retain their widened style).

### Future Work:
- Work-in-progress: Adjustments on window-resize for better usability.
- Upcoming: Resetting element width to original size.
- More enhancements to be added soon.

Happy widening!
